                    <p>Welcome to my page. If you're seeing for the first time and we haven't met, consider it a pleasure! I am currently a 6+ year IT/SysAdmin looking for my place in the programming world.</p>
                    <p>I have no formal education and minimal workplace experience but hopefully my site here can convince you that I can do a developer's job regardless. About two years ago, I started coding as a hobby, but my hope was always that it would lead to a career. I've been slowly building the skillset to build and present this website/webapp to you today.</p>
                    <p>On this page, you may find a lack of styling and fancy front-end development. However, that is not what I hope you'll remember me for; my true passion is back-end development and functionality. You'll find just that here. Below, I present a collection of various systems that I hope you'll find impressive.</p>
                    <p>So without further ado, go ahead and see what I have to show you!</p>
