My Portfolio (In Progress)

As seen above, this is IN PROGRESS. I am currently learning the ins and outs of Django framework and implementing fun or impressive ideas into it as I figure it out. Today, there is no functionality to the webapp. The skeleton is still being developed. My current hang-up is styling Django form/model elements for an appropriate look on the page. 

Once I've progressed, the next step should be to implement a first function. My idea for a first function is to take user input (a NYSE code like MSFT or GOOG), query a stock API, and output the stock information to a graph or chart built by myself.

Lastly, as you can see, I have some fundamentals of HTML and CSS/SCSS. Take some time to look through the work I've completed so far. Thanks for checking it out!
